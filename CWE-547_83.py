#9.# Security Misconfiguration:


from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return 'Hello, world!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)


# The vulnerable line is line 8, where the Flask app is running in debug mode, which can expose sensitive information and allow for remote code execution attacks.
